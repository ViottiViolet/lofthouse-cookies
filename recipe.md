For Lofthouse Cookies
In the bowl of your stand mixer with the whisk attachment (or you can use a hand mixer) cream together the butter, margarine and powdered sugar until light and fluffy
Add in your vanilla, almond extract and egg and mix on medium until combined
Add in your baking soda, baking powder, salt, cream of tartar and cornstarch and mix until combined
Switch to the paddle attachment and mix in your cake flour just until combined. Do not overmix (or you can do this by hand)
Scoop your batter onto a parchment-lined baking sheet with a medium-sized cookie scoop (or you can use a spoon)
Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 2 hours (or up to 24 hours)
Preheat your oven to 375ÂºF
Roll the chilled dough into balls and then flatten with your fingers into cookies that are about 1/2" thick and 3" wide. Arrange on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
Bake your cookies for 8-9 minutes or just until the sheen disappears from the top of the cookie. Place onto a cooling rack to cool fully before frosting with buttercream and finishing with sprinkles
Store leftover cookies in an airtight container for up to a week or freeze

For Frosting
In the bowl of your stand mixer (or using a hand mixer) cream your butter until smooth using the whisk attachment
Start adding your powdered sugar while mixing on low until it's all incorporated.
Add in your vanilla, milk, salt, and food coloring and mix until smooth.
Pipe on top of the cookies with a round tip (I used an 804) and top with sprinkles
